Commands available to set the environment for subsequent cursor
activity:
<SWITCH>  Allows setting device for numerical OUTPUT. If OUTPUT=CON,
          then numerical data will be printed on graphics screen
<PLOT>    Will cause both the layout and contour plots to be
          displayed prior to the appearance of the cursor.
<LAYOUT>  Will cause layout to be displayed prior to appearance
          of the cursor.
<TOL>(TOL)
          Sets the tolerance for subsequent MOVE commands
          (see below) to TOL.
<PAGE>    Clears both the text and graphics screens.
<START>   Will cause the cursor to be displayed.
<LAYER>   (NUMBER)
          Sets the layer number in which subsequent information in
          CURSOR will be displayed.  Unlike other modules in
          MLAEM, a change in the layer number in CURSOR will not
          carry over into other modules.
<GRID>    Allows a new grid to be made (without going to the main menu)
<RETURN>  Makes it possible to leave the routine without engaging
          in any cursor activity.

Once in cursor mode, enter any of the following commands.
<LAYER>   (NUMBER)
          Sets the layer number in which subsequent information in
          CURSOR will be displayed.  Unlike other modules in
          MLAEM, a change in the layer number in CURSOR will not
          carry over into other modules.
<HEAD>    Causes HEAD to be computed and printed.
<POTENTIAL>[LAYER]
          Causes both POTENTIAL and STREAM FUNCTION to be printed
          (STREAM FUNCTION has meaning only if the infiltration rate
          at position of cursor is zero).
<DISCHARGE>[LAYER]
          Causes the two components of the DISCHARGE VECTOR in the
          layer to be printed.
<LOWBOUN>[LAYER]
          Causes the elevation of the lower boundary to be printed.
<COORDINATES>
          Prints coordinates of cursor location. A line is drawn from
          the previous point to the current point. You may prevent
          this line from being drawn by pressing enter twice. You
          should do this prior to entering any other command.
<WLL>     Records set of coordinates for lower left corner of the new
          WINDOW.  Move the cursor to the upper right corner of the
          window and press enter. You may abandon by entering any key
          other than enter; the cursor will then reappear ready for
          the next command.  The screen will be cleared and the new
          WINDOW will be activated.
<MENU>    Exit from graphics mode; return to main cursor menu.
<TOLERANCE>
          Sets the tolerance for MOVE commands, e.g., commands that
          will allow the user to modify endpoints of line-sinks.
          Entering this command followed by moving the cursor will
          cause a temporary line to be drawn from the position of the
          cursor at the time the command was given to the current
          cursor position.  Pressing the enter key will cause the
          tolerance to be stored as the length of the displayed line.
          This value will be displayed on the screen.  If you press
          ENTER without moving the cursor, the current tolerance will
          be displayed.
<SIZE>    Sets the
          maximum size for the display of discharge vectors
          to the distance between the previous cursor location and
          the current one.
<NDISCHARGE>
          Makes it possible to plot the discharge normal to any given
          line. The discharge is computed at the midpoint of the line
          between the current cursor location and the next one, defined
          by entering a carriage return. A rubberband line is displayed
          if the command is entered properly. Discharge in this context
          is the component of the discharge vector normal to the line.
          Points and discharges up to a maximum of 50 are recorded.
          Plotting is deferred until the command <ENDISCHARGE> is given.
          A scale factor is then computed such that the largest vector
          is equal to SIZE. Both tangential and normal components of
          the discharge vector are recorded on the OUTPUT device, as
          well as the coordinates of the points in question and the
          scale factor. The normal component of discharge is taken
          positive if pointing to the left with respect to an arrow
          pointing from the first to the second point entered.
<ENDISCHARGE>
          Terminates the entry of points for plotting normal components
          of discharge.
<WLMOVE>  [DISCHARGE]
          Makes it possible to change the locations of wells and to
          change their discharge.  Move the cursor within a distance
          of TOL from the well, then move the cursor to the desired
          location and press ENTER.  If you don't move the cursor,
          the current well attributes will be displayed.  You may
          change the discharge of the well by entering the discharge
          as an optional parameter.  If you move the cursor, a line
          will appear connecting the old and new locations of the
          well.  To facilitate updating of input files, both the old
          and new locations of the well and the well number
          (according to its position in the input file) are printed
          on the OUTPUT device.  It is recommended to echo OUTPUT to
          a file by the use of the SWITCH command.
<MARKER>    Makes it possible to mark a point on the screen with a
          marker; this marker is temporary and will not appear on
          subsequent plots. The marker may be used, for example, in
          conjunction with the DISTANCE command.
<DISTANCE>Prints the distance from the location of the cursor when
          <DISTANCE> is entered to the new position
 <RETURN>  Exit from CURSOR ROUTINE.
