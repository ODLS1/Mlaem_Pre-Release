## MLAEM Development Roadmap

MLAEM is currently being developed by a small team of open-source volunteers in a passionate effort to recover the substantial investment made in this classic groundwater modeling code base from 1976-2006.

Due to the current nature of the project, this roadmap is *notional* and could change *significantly* depending on changing priorities, illnesses, workload, etc. Said in a different way, please do not make business decisions based on the roadmap and only use it as the rough and notional guide for project priorities that it was intended to be.
